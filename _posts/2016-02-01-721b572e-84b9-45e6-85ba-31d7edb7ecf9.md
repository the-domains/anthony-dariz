SIN'S HAIR BAR & SPA

Concept Statement: 
To bring in the very nature of design at it's simplest form 
to elevate and revive the body, spirit, and surroundings by 
minimizing distractions and accentuating interest. What looks 
good and makes you feel the most is, in and of itself Striking 
Design.

Project Goal: 
What was once a bank was to be re-purposed keeping the 
bank's vault a feature in the new design as well as a fireplace 
inclusion. Essential areas needed were Color, Make-up, 
Shampoo, Drying, Hair, Massage, and Wax stations. Other core 
areas include Guest seating and back office.

Wayfinding: 
The inspiration for the salon's flooring detail was a nod to the Cairns (stack of stones) 
that hikers often use as markers to find their way through an off trail.

Charcoal Dust VCT Flooring by Armstrong:
12 x 24 flooring selected for guest rooms

Great Blue Heron at Elizabeth Park
By

Ginny Lowe Connors

I stop when I see it standing there, smoky blue in low waters, a bird Modigliani might have 
invented. Without thinking, I take on its stillness. My breathing slows, focus sharpens. Is it 
telepathy that shapes me, for a moment, in this bird's image?

And then it leaps into flight, its wings too large to believe. Unnerving, its sudden change 
from slender statue to menacing motion, to a density and darkness that makes the pale 
sky seem a paltry thing. And though I am earthbound, clumsy and plain,

something hushed and unsullied stirs within me. I feel it, the belief that we can rise above 
the weight of our mistakes, that any of us can be, if only briefly, large against the sky. I 
look toward the island in this pond, where a birch tree leans over water.

On an extended branch the heron lands, becomes another limb set against evening sky. 
Like smoke, that bird transformed itself and I am trying to believe it, that we can do it too, 
and that a place of safety waits for each of us, white branch hanging over water.

Chaine Homme Tile by Fireclay Tile:
Recycled clay tile in Nautical, Jade and Gypsum selected for
